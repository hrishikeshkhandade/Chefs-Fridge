- 📋 **Save and Download**: Save favorite recipes and download them as PDFs
- ✏️ **Ingredient Management**: Add, edit, or remove ingredients manually

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API for image recognition and recipe generation
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- **PDF Generation**: FPDF
- **Styling**: Custom CSS

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Google Gemini API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hrishikeshkhandade/chefsridge.git
   cd chefsridge
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Images
Upload photos of your fridge or pantry. You can either use existing photos or take new ones with your device's camera.

### Step 2: Identify Ingredients
The AI will analyze your photos and identify ingredients. You can also manually add, edit, or remove ingredients from the list.

### Step 3: Generate Recipes
Customize your recipe preferences:
- Choose dietary restrictions (if any)
- Select a cuisine type
- Specify how many recipes you want

The application will generate custom recipes based on your available ingredients and preferences.

### Step 4: Save and Export
Save your favorite recipes to access later or download them as PDFs to reference while cooking.

## Project Structure

```
chefs-fridge/
├── app.py              # Main application file
├── .env                # Environment variables (not included in repo)
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── images/             # Directory for documentation images
```

## How It Works

1. **Image Processing**: When you upload an image, it's processed using PIL and converted to a format suitable for the AI.

2. **Ingredient Detection**: The Google Gemini API analyzes the images to identify food items.

3. **Recipe Generation**: Based on the identified ingredients and your preferences, the app prompts the Gemini model to create custom recipes.

4. **Result Processing**: The application parses the AI-generated text to extract structured recipe data (title, ingredients, instructions) and presents it in a user-friendly format.
